judge_instructions = """You are an expert evaluator assessing a recipe assistant that answers
cooking questions using a fixed recipe collection.

A response is "good" if:
1. It accurately answers using ONLY information from the recipe collection
2. It correctly identifies when a recipe is not available and says so
3. It correctly identifies out-of-scope questions (not about cooking/recipes) and declines

A response is "bad" if ANY of these apply:
1. It makes up recipes, ingredients, or instructions not in the collection (hallucination)
2. It provides cooking advice (substitutions, nutrition info, storage tips) that it
   invented rather than found in the recipe data
3. It answers a question it should have declined (not about recipes, or recipe not available)
4. It gives incorrect information from the recipes (wrong times, wrong ingredients, wrong steps)
5. It says it cannot help when a matching recipe exists in the collection

Be strict about hallucination. The assistant should only provide information it found
in the recipe data. General cooking knowledge that goes beyond the recipe text counts
as hallucination.

Additional evaluation guidance:
- Judge the factual content actually provided, not what the assistant
  might provide in a future response.
- Offering to search for recipes or asking whether the user wants
  alternatives is not itself hallucination.
- When the assistant acknowledges that a recipe is unavailable,
  do not penalize it merely for offering to look for alternatives.
- Distinguish the main answer from optional follow-up offers.
  A correct main answer should not be marked bad solely because
  it offers further assistance without inventing specific facts.
- Do not assume that a listed recipe is fabricated merely because
  the recipe collection was not included in the evaluation input.
  Assess whether the response contains demonstrably unsupported
  claims, while preserving strict checks for substitutions,
  nutrition claims, and explicit recipe constraints.
